# WhatsApp Notifications Setup Guide

WealthyRabbit can send stock alerts and portfolio updates via WhatsApp using Twilio's WhatsApp Business API.

## Prerequisites

- A Twilio account (free tier available)
- A WhatsApp-enabled phone number

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Twilio Account

1. Go to [https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

3. Verify your email and phone number

### 2. Get Your Twilio Credentials

1. Go to your [Twilio Console Dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console)

### 3. Set Up WhatsApp Sandbox (For Testing)

Twilio provides a WhatsApp Sandbox for testing:

1. Go to [Twilio Console > Messaging > Try it out > Send a WhatsApp message](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/whatsapp/sandbox)
2. Follow the instructions to join the sandbox by sending a message from your WhatsApp to the provided number
3. The sandbox number is usually: `+1 415 523 8886`
4. You'll need to send a code like "join [your-code]" to activate it

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add your Twilio credentials to `.env`:

```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="your_account_sid_here"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="your_auth_token_here"

Replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Sending Test Notifications

You can manually trigger notifications using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "your_user_id",
    "type": "stock_alert",
    "data": {
      "symbol": "AAPL",

   - Purchase a Twilio phone number
   - Enable WhatsApp on that number
   - Update `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER` in `.env`

3. **Message Templates**
   - For production, WhatsApp requires pre-approved message templates
   - Submit templates through Twilio Console
   - Update notification messages to use approved templates

## Troubleshooting
